Digital garden is a place to store and develop long term thoughts.

## Inspiration

- [[Andy Matuschak]]'s [notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/)
- [[Joel Hooks]]' [thoughts digital garden post](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)
- [[Tom Critchlow]]'s [digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/)

[[Aegnus McMillin]] got [`@aengusm/gatsby-theme-brain`](https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/gatsby-theme-brain) going and the concept is super dope.

Serious props to [[Aravind Balla]] for getting the prototype of notes hover preview as well as the "Referred in" section.
